## Story
Throughout the game, you'll use 'Multinet Linux', a fiction Linux distribution developed entirely by an AI. The AI, coined 'GalaxyAI', also developed the Multinet itself, and entirely new way of connecting and sharing ideas. Think of it as an alternate internet. However, the research team behind Multinet has discovered a phenomenon known as 'ghost servers'. These servers don't seem to have any location in the real world, and only seem to exist on the Multinet, and nowhere else. Through basic terminal commands (ones that computer techies are likely already familiar with), you are free to explore the Multinet, and discover the true nature of the so called 'ghost servers'.

## Features
### Realistic
Multinet uses realistic Unix commands, meaning players familiar with computers will likely already be familiar with the game mechanics.

### Immersive Storyline
The game contains over a dozen different websites and servers, along with a handful of commands, meaning the game should always feel very immersive.

### Educational
Despite the game using realistic Unix commands, the skill required to learn the game and execute many of the required actions is very low, so much so that you may pick up on the basics of command-line based computer interaction just by playing through the game!

### Difficulty
Multinet has a plethora of puzzles and investigation paths you'll have to complete in order to finish the game. These puzzles are tricky, but still fairly intuitive to complete for those familiar with computers, and if you get stuck, theres nothing stopping you from finding a creative way around them!
