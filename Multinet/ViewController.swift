However, for the servers we didn't facilitate the creation of, the locations ended up in places out in the 'middle of nowhere' so to speak. In other words, we were unable to successfully identify the locations of any of the pre-existing servers. As a result, these servers are now known as 'ghost servers' among the research team members.\n\nHere is a list of the currently known ghost servers, though their are likely thousands more we've yet to encounter. Many of them appear to be politically related, but don't align with real world occurances, and instead portray a dystopian theme of sorts:\n1: wbc.com\n2: freedom.net\n3: us.gov";

Sharing this server address with anyone other than class 1 government officials is considered treason.\n\nSection 1: After the restriction of the internet, unrecognized users have been detected using restricted networks. Upon further research into these users, it was discovered that their physical locations when traced lead to obscure places, none of which accurately line up with any internet connected devices. This is despite the previous 100% recorded accuracy of the tracing algorithms used. This lead to multiple theories, only one of which has yet to be disproven.\n\nSection 2: The standing hypothesis is that these illusive network users are not using conventional methods of connecting to the internet. However, heavy internet restriction technologies ensure that it would be nearly impossible for any human to connect to the internet with any unconventional system. This leads to the conclusion that these users are not human.\n\nSection 3: The next step was to study these users and their habits to attempt to determine who they are, and where they come from. They connected to many different servers, apparently searching for something. However, these users were protected by some unknown type of data encryption, preventing most attempts to view what servers they were connecting to.\n\nSection 4: Multiple requests were made involving one key word, so we directed all of our security team to attempting to crack it. Upon doing so successfully, we uncovered the phrase to be 'Multinet'. Further research was done into this term. Multinet has never been used to refer to any group or organization. Notably however, conspiracy theorists have brought up the concept of an alternate universe roaming our internet over what they referred to as the 'Multinet'. This theory was disregarded.\n\nSection 5: Using the Multinet key phrase, we were able to decrypt another notable phrase from the ghost users: 'galaxyai.com'. Upon disecting this server, we've established that it appears to be run by an advanced artificial intelligence being, one far more complex then anything ever developed by the US government, or any foreign nation. It was established that this AI could likely be capable of forming an alternate method of connection to the internet, despite the heavy restrictions.\n\nSection 6: In order to combat this AI software, we've constructed our own based on the deconstructed code of 'GalaxyAI' as it's referred to on the galaxyai.com server. It can be downloaded at darkoceanai.com. However, we've been unable to successfully execute it on any machine we've tested it on. No matter what we try, it always fails with the response: 'Unusual physical properties'. We've yet to figure out what this means. We've tried placing the machines in different humidity, temperatures, and even levels of gravity different from the standard 12 m/s squared we know on our planet. Notably, the program ran for slightly longer before failing when placed under 70Â°F, 50% humidity, and 9.8 m/s squared of gravity. We've been unable to figure out why this is so.";
